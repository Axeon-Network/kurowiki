hello sirs, foxes and madamms welcome i am john shrek and this is 2 /j


up where the mountains meet the heavens above
out where the lightning splits the sea
i could swear that theres someone somewhere watching me
through the wind and the chill and the rain
and the storm and the flood
...then the next part is shit.

then it goes

na na na naaa
i need a hero!
i'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning of light.
and he's gotta be sure!
and it's gotta be soon!
and he's gotta be larger than life!


then we get the puss in boots cute moment

uh then it goes to the chorus again i guess
then fiona knocks out charming
then shrek kisses fiona

then happy ending
