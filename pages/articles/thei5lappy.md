**Thei5Lappy** (temporarily known as **SuperNova** in July-August 2025; model *Dell Latitude 3380*), is a laptop manufactered by Dell Inc. in 2017. It is [Nekori](Nekori)'s main PC since November 2024.

The nickname `Thei5Lappy` is a reference to [TheCeleryPC](TheCeleryPC)'s nickname, as it follows the same scheme: `The`...is self-explanatory, `i5` for the computer's processor (an Intel Core i5-7200U), and `Lappy` for laptop.

# History and Overview

Following the death of TheCeleryPC and haitus of several projects in 3 November 2024, Nekori was gifted a new computer by their dad on 29 November 2025.

The computer originally ran Windows 10 Pro Education x64 when it was given to Nekori, due to Nekori's location, the OS was in Spanish, until Nekori changed it to English a few days later.

## Computer Specs

The computer's hardware is the following:

- Intel Core i5 7th Gen (Kaby Lake; i5-7200U)
- Intel HD Graphics 620 - *Integrated GPU*
- 8GB DDR4 RAM
- 238GB Samsung SATA SSD - Later replaced to a **465 GiB Toshiba MQ01ABF050 HDD**

# Charger Issues

Around 29 May 2025, the computer's charger's state had become increasingly worse compared to when Nekori first got it, so bad that at that point **it would only charge in a certain position**.<br>The charger's state has further worsened from here on to the point where a day later, it would simply **no longer charge** anymore, leaving Nekori with no choice but to use Windows in a minimal manner:

    </div>


On 31 May 2025, Nekori's dad arrived at Nekori's house at 5pm CST to try to fix the charger via soldering and duck tape, the charger worked since Nekori's dad fixed the charger at a working position.

Due to the nature of the fix, the charger wasn't 100% perfect. It continued to malfunction every now and then, with Nekori starting to make fun about this problem via the **Dad Fixes Incorporated** joke. After 2 July 2025, the issues started to relapse, and on 8 July 2025, Nekori's dad came to Nekori's house again to repair the charger once more.

Interestingly enough, Nekori tried their sister's charger prior to the second fix, which has been tested to work since both computers are similar, with model numbers apart (*Latitude E6420* and *Latitude 3380* respectively). Nonetheless, Nekori kept using their original laptop charger to avoid getting into any problems. On 10 July 2025, the original charger sparked, burning Nekori's hand.

Nekori began using their sister's charger, with permision from their mother after the incident.
