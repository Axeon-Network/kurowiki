**KuroWiki build 4177** is a Beta 6 build of KuroWiki, compiled on 9 November 2025 at 1:34AM UTC+2 from the `kayaurora` development branch

This build finalizes the implementation of the Random Article button, which was included as early as [build 3880](KuroWiki_build_3880) from nearly 2 weeks prior in the drawer, where clicking on it wouldn't do anything. It was initially meant to be finished in time for [the next public release](KuroWiki_build_4100), however it was ultimately delayed with the button just commented out with the note that "it will be implemented in a later build".
