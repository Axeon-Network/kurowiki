**NekoCafe**[^1] is a Discord server created by [Nekori](Nekori) on 30 August 2025 and opened publicly on 31 August 2025. It is the spiritual successor to [StuffyXP Hangout](StuffyXP_Hangout), [HoriServer (2)](HoriServer_(2)) and the [NovaServer](NovaServer) [Stoat](https://stoat.chat) server.

# Background

Shortly after Nekori's August return, Nekori made a server named **HoriServer III**[^2] as a joke, to mimic the "no HoriServer (3)" promise that Nekori made after HoriServer (2)'s closure. That server was shortly nuked and deleted. After that, **HoriServer IV** was made as another joke.

Nekori started thinking about making a proper server of them, thus NekoCafe was created privately, with its invite link sent to HoriServer IV seconds later. The server was setup by Nekori 3 hours later.
