**A VMware First-Timer installs Windows XP!** (also reffered to as **VMware First Time** by Nekori) is the first public [StuffyXP](StuffyXP) video by [Nekori](Nekori). It was uploaded to YouTube on **13 February 2024** and had a total view count of **548 views** before the StuffyXP channel was deleted on 14 March 2025.

The video consisted of Nekori installing Windows XP Professional SP3 on a VMware 12 virtual machine on Windows 8.1. It is the first StuffyXP video of 2024, as well as the first video to be made on [TheCeleryPC](TheCeleryPC)

Addionally, 2 YouTube Shorts were uploaded to the StuffyXP channel showing a sneak peak of the video, with an audio bug from the video editor, and another one showing the analytics of the video as of 2 days later.

# Development

Shortly after 2024 started (and Nekori finding their friend group), Nekori was inspired by them [the friend group] to also make their own tech videos on YouTube, they started to find a video editor that was compatible with their daily driver at the time, [TheCeleryPC](TheCeleryPC).

After finding the program, video production began.<br>Unfortunely, the original project file ended up being somewhat corrupted, as Camtasia wrongfully thought that the video file was from an older version of Camtasia and had to be upgraded, after the so-called upgrade, the file was left blank.<br>This delayed the video from its original 8 January upload date to **14 January**. It happened again on **16 January**, delaying the video even further to **26 January**.

The video was delayed again in **28 January** due to Nekori bricking their Windows 8.1 installation, causing them to enhance and re-add several parts of the video in their Windows Vista installation, after that, the power outlet that powered TheCeleryPC died and had to be replaced, causing the video to be delayed for almost a week. Nekori upgraded to Windows 7 one day before the video was uploaded.

The video had to be delayed again, this time for almost a week due to the death of the power outlet that used to power TheCeleryPC.

# After the collab

Coinciding with the upload of the [KayAurora-Nekori Video Collab](KayAurora_and_Nekori_Collab), the featured videos had their thumbnails changed to march the newer versions made on the collab, this was one of the featured videos.

Additionally, Nekori also updated the video's description to fit with the description style of their newer videos, with a notice telling the viewer that its an old video and that they should watch their newer ones.
