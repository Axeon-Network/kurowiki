# History

The channel was created by Nekori on 13 March 2020 as "Yoshi Land0842". As claimed by Nekori, the name originated from their Mario Kart DS online play username, it was also noted by Nekori that the name was originally *Yoshi Island0842*, but due to the input's 14 character limit, it stuck as **Yoshi Land0842**.

The channel was rebranded from **Yoshi Land0842** to **Stuff Life** in early 2021.

The channel had no content available until April 2021, as that is the month where 2 of Nekori's short films (featuring [Dogui](Dogui) and their other plushies) were uploaded, Nekori claims that both of these were created in 3 hours using InShot, a mobile video editor on their Galaxy J5, which was a gift from their dad.

Nekori kept uploading videos to the channel until December 2021, as the year ended with a "<span id="tt3">Next in 2022...</span>" video, a video featuring Nekori's upcoming releases for said year. None of these were uploaded in the year, thus making 2022 the most empty year for the channel, this was claimly due to Nekori focusing on his life and getting good grades.

2023 was the revival for the channel, per-se, as some videos of them were uploaded, some included a COVID-19-based video of their plushies chatting in a Zoom-like UX, with all of them ""talking"" (in reality just Nekori making high-pitched sounds.) at the same time and its sequel, a morning routine of some of his plushies, and more original short films.

\- *Nekori's thoughts regarding the plushie era of StuffyXP, 2024*

2023 also was the year that Nekori started doing tech videos, most of these being using Virtualbox and installing operating systems like Windows XP, these were filmed with Nekori's phone due to them not knowing about screencast software.

There was also a video of them re-installing Windows 7 on their host, which would make the first public appearance of Nekori's [eMachines ET1810](/TheCeleryPC) (nicknamed `TheCeleryPC`) that would become their daily driver for almost 2 years before dying due to a broken PSU in Late 2024.

The channel re-branded to **Stuffy** in 3 October 2023, with `@StuffyYT20` as the handle, before deciding on `@StuffyXP` a few weeks later.

The origin of the StuffyXP name actually comes back from [Nekori's old Reddit account](https://reddit.com/u/StuffyXP), as when creating a new account, Nekori thought of appending a Windows version to the name as "Stuffy" wasn't available, they originally thought of `Stuffy7`, but then changed it at the last minute to `StuffyXP` after realizing that Reddit Mods won't be happy of that (citation needed).

In July 2024, the channel received a Windows Whistler-themed rebrand. The channel name "Stuffy" had also been changed to StuffyXP as part of the rebrand.

Other projects have also been made throughout 2024 under the StuffyXP umbrella, officially referred to collectively as the "*StuffyXP Network*":

- **StuffyXP Website**: Nekori's personal website while they were known as StuffyXP, the precursor to HoriWebsite and other iterations leading up to today's [LexSite](/LexSite). Initial development in late February 2024, discontinued early January 2025 in favor of HoriWebsite.
- **StuffyXP Hangout**: a Discord Server primarily meant for fans of the StuffyXP channel and the wider Network to hangout in. Succeeded [Stuffy's Place](/Stuffys_Place) in early October 2024, shut down March 2025 with the StuffyXP Closure.
- **StuffyXP Extras (& Co.)**: with the Whistler-themed rebrand of StuffyXP, other StuffyXP channels have received StuffyXP naming as well, with the exception of Stuffy 64. In November 2024, Stuffy+ had been renamed to StuffyXP Extras, and Stuffy Vlogs as StuffyXP Vlogs.

## StuffyXP Extras

**StuffyXP Extras** (formerly known as **StuffyXP Plus** and **Stuffy +** (`@StuffyPlus`)) was a YouTube channel owned and operated by Nekori created on 26 June 2021. Its primary focus was being a place for "random shitposts, behind-the-scenes footage", etc.

The channel's subscriber count was low, and mainly featured videos like Nekori's voice reveal, test footage, raw footage and more.

It was originally Nekori's vlogs channel (as seen in the brand account's name, *Sttuf Blogs*, the typo is actually there, as Nekori didn't know how to spell the word *stuff* yet) but became an extras channel around the time when the StuffyXP channel was called *Stuffy* and had [Dogui](Dogui) as its primary branding.

Addionally, Nekori has used the channel for backup purposes, mainly for when the StuffyXP channel was false-striked due to **Geometry Dash...on Windows Vista!?**.

## StuffyXP Vlogs

**StuffyXP Vlogs** (formerly known as **Stuffy Vlogs**) was a YouTube channel owned and operated by Nekori created on 14 July 2021. Its suggested focus was being Nekori's vlog channel, but that never came to life due to "no interesting events happening in Nekori's life", while in reality was the lack of interest and equipment for creating vlog-style videos.

The channel never had any sort of content but was updated every time something needed to be updated (e.g branding, links, copyright), though one *test* video was uploaded to the channel sometime around March 2024 to test the YouTube functionality of Carl-Bot.

A video for the channel was planned sometime in late 2024, allegedly titled **The $5 Wireless Keyboard & Mouse Combo -- Will they work?**, aluding to its name, consisted of Nekori testing a keyboard & mouse combo whose value was $5 (~130 <span id="tt4">HNL</span>). The video was cancelled due to the combo not being able to connect to a computer due to a missing USB-to-wireless adapter, which wasn't included in the box. Nekori still owns this combo to this day.

The channel was originally known as **MisAnimacionesPencil2D** (english: MyAnimsPencil2D) which was going to be used as a place for Nekori to upload his animations made in Pencil2D, a freeware animation program. The channel was eventually converted to Stuffy Vlogs sometime around in mid 2023.

## Stuffy 64

**Stuffy 64** (formerly known as **Stuff Life 64**) was a YouTube channel owned and operated by Nekori created in 4 August 2023. The channel's main focus was for uploaded gaming-related content from Nekori, and is the only one channel who retroactively co-existed with StuffyXP regarding video uploads.

The channel's first uploads were YouTube Shorts of Nekori's Super Mario 64 save file (which is why the channel is called Stuffy 64, a nod to the Nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64), one of these was footage of Nekori getting to the credits sequence in the game after collecting the Big Star that Bowser drops after defeated in the final battle, another was Nekori showcasing some Super Mario 64 bugs and glitches, like how to get to *Tower of the Wing Cap* without directly looking at the ceiling in Peach's Castle, or clipping through walls via item boxes.

The channel was revived in early 2024, with its staring videos being a gameplay of **96flashbacks**, a Super Mario 64 mod designed to replicate the look and feel of the Super Mario 64 E3 demo footage, the series only lasted 6 episodes, out of the 8 Nekori originally expected, this was due to Nekori losing their save file after reinstalling Windows on their host machine.

Around mid 2024, the channel was revived again with a focus on [*Mario & Luigi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_&_Luigi) content, mainly the third game in the franchise, **Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story** for Nintendo DS released in 2009, it is Nekori's favorite game of the franchise.

The Mario & Luigi era was the time where the upload count increased significantly, mainly due to how it easy it was for Nekori to upload videos at the time, the channel even surpassed the StuffyXP upload count and for a short period of time, surpassed StuffyXP in subscribers. This was mainly due to the channels' activity and inactivity.

The Mario & Luigi content featured videos like the debug room, the gauntlet and other types of stuff, Partners in Time and Superstar Saga videos were also uploaded, though PiT only had one upload and SS only had 2, which were the demo shown at E3 2003.

Shortly after Nekori got their new PC ([Thei5Lappy](Thei5Lappy)), Geometry Dash videos were also uploaded, these include level showcases, bugs, and sometimes achievements (like completing Hexagon Force until 92%).

## StuffyXP VODS

**StuffyXP VODS** was a YouTube channel owned and operated by Nekori created in 22 December 2024. Its main purpose was to archive streams from Nekori, but it never eventually uploaded anything, and the latter was deleted when the StuffyXP channels were moved to their respective separate emails.

# Closure

On 16 March 2025, the StuffyXP YouTube channels were officially shut down, Nekori chose to use YouTube's "Hide your channel" feature, a technicality that allows for future reclamation, though no such decision has been made.

<!--- The StuffyXP channels closed on 16 March 2025 via YouTube's "Hide your channel" feature, which allowed Nekori to re-take the channels whenever they wanted, though that oportunity hasn't been used as a true decision. -->

The main reason of the closure was essentially Nekori's lack of interest in content creation and their wintuber career, as stated some time ago:

> It is really hard to come up with a good video idea, and most of the other videos ideas are kinda lame.
> One thing that i never even liked is that whenever you do an overused video idea (like idk installing some random longhorn build) get views while original experiments do not, which decreased my interest.

-- Nekori, December 2024

Addionally, Nekori's mental health status was getting worse, the only way for them to achieve peace was to get rid of some stuff, Nekori didn't want to just abandon the channels, they wanted them gone. Nekori is also against the archival of the StuffyXP content.

The StuffyXP channel was re-enabled on 1 April 2025 as an April Fools joke, but it only lasted for 1 day, as the joke.
