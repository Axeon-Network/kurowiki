**TheCeleryPC** (model: *eMachines ET1810 Revision 3*) is a desktop computer from 2009 manufactured by eMachines. It was [Nekori](Nekori)'s main PC from 2021 to 2024, when its PSU died.

The nickname `TheCeleryPC` is a nod to the computer's processor, an *Intel Celeron 420*, commonly jokingly named "Celery" online.

##### History & Overview
The PC was given to Nekori as a gift from his uncle in 19 June 2021. It originally ran Windows 7 Professional x86, and over time ran all Windows versions from XP to 10, as well as Linux distros like Xubuntu or Ubuntu Server.

The computer has been publicly shown as far back as 2023 on a StuffyXP video from the Stuff Life era.

###### Death of the PSU
Once electricity was reinstated in Honduras following an outage on 3 November 2024, TheCeleryPC turned on "all of a sudden" by itself and started making fan noises while also been smelling like smoke. Nekori has posted a Short about it on [StuffyXP](StuffyXP) channel, which would be the final public appearance of the computer in a video.

In the [*StuffyXP Wrapped: 2024 Edition*](https://horibyte.is-a.dev/blog/2024/12/31/stuffyxp-wrapped-2024-edition.html) blog post, Nekori stated that after an investigation with his dad, they eventually figured out that when power came back, it "overloaded the thing that gives DC making it no longer give DC, making some components unable to power on". Parts relying on AC (such as the fans) continued to work.

StuffyXP and other of Nekori's projects at the time have went on a hiatus for the following few weeks until being replaced by [Thei5Lappy](Thei5Lappy) as Nekori's Main PC.
