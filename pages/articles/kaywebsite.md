**KayWebsite** (also known after its URL name, [kay.is-a.dev](https://kay.is-a.dev)) is [KayAurora](KayAurora)'s personal website. It officially launched on 23 July 2024 as a complete rewrite unifying [LynxWebsite](LynxWebsite) and the [Lynxmic Blog](Lynxmic_Blog) under a single codebase using fully plain HTML+CSS, coinciding with the Clyron-Lynxmic online identity split in the same day.

#### History
##### Version 1.x
For the first month, the website had a generic rudimentary design using the first Clyron branding's color pallete (then known under the temporary name of "Sunn"/"Sunnville") (*v1.0*).
Plans were for the website layout to eventually evolve into a Win2K-style design, which were essentially completed by late August 2024. This version of the website, then known as **ClyronWebsite**, is retroactively referred to as *v1.1*, which primarily served as a landing page with links to socials and projects with a blog in the website as well. It has been tested to work on ancient browsers as old as Internet Explorer 6.

Further updates were planned to improve the overall design, but they never happened and instead only small changes have been done updating the list of projects and socials as needed.

        style="width:50%; height:auto" %}
</div>

##### Version 2.x
In October 2024, plans were planted over for a complete rewrite of KayWebsite (then known as **ClyronWebsite**), switching from Jekyll to Astro. The website layout was originally planned to remain as-is but it was decided later on that the website receives a complete redesign using Tailwind CSS.

The development of v2.0 took more than 3 months, mainly due to KayAurora's lack of motivation and interest. An initial public beta released on 11 January 2025 with frequent rolling updates as the rewrite progressed.

v2.0 was finally finished almost a month later, on 9 February 2025, when it replaced v1.1.

##### Version 3.x
Plans for a ClyronWebsite v3.0 trace back to May 2025, as KayAurora had been considering major changes that mandated a major version number bump, such as dropping Tailwind CSS, thus regaining full control over the CSS, in order to build a Retro Frontend, mainly inspired from [Nekori](Nekori)'s [HoriWebsite](HoriWebsite).
Like with the HoriWebsite retro frontend, KayAurora wanted to build one using Microsoft FrontPage 2003, but plans later shifted to just building it on top of the existing Astro ClyronWebsite, to keep maintenence burden low.

Much of v3.0's development happened in July 2025, immediately after v2.5.2's release. The website has undergone a new major visual overhaul, also nicely incorporating the design of the then-fairly-new KayAurora branding.

v3.0 was finished and released on 18 July 2025, with the website now known under its current naming of **KayWebsite**. The Retro Frontend came later on 24 July 2025 with v3.1, [extensively and thoroughly tested](https://kay.is-a.dev/blog/2025-07-24-how-low-can-you-go-browser-compatibility/) for compatibility with ancient browsers.
