The **A Board** (also known as the **🅰️ Board**) is a message board channel present in the [NekoCafe](NekoCafe), [Axeon Network](Axeon_Netwokr#discord-server) and [HoriServer (2)](HoriServer_(2)) Discord servers. Similar to a starboard, its main functionality is sending messages reacted with an [🅰️ emoji](A_Emoji) to said channel.

#### History

The concept of an A Board came before the launch of [Nekori](Nekori64)'s HoriServer (2), on which Nekori and [KayAurora](KayAurora) eventually made one.

The earliest picture of the A Board dates to 12 March 2025[^1] and can be seen at Nekori's old Mastodon account.
