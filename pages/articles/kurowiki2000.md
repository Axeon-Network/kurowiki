**KuroWiki build 2000** (full tag: `4.2.2000.kuro_escro.250725-1423`) is a Beta 4 build of KuroWiki, compiled on 25 July 2025 at 2:23PM UTC-6.

It is the first known build to use the name "KuroWiki". It is one of the 3 builds compiled from the `kuro_escro` branch, alongside `4.2.2001.kuro_escro.250725-1527` and `4.2.2002.kuro_escro.250725-1533` which were compiled 1 hour later on the same day.

A screenshot of this build was posted to the [NovaServer](NovaServer) Stoat server, where a tab of it was open on the [Nekori Arctic](Nekori_Arctic) page (at the time LexNova Arctic). As seen in the drawer, this build refers to itself as "DeltaWiki Engine Beta 4 Escrow", while the "KuroWiki Contributors" moniker was used for the copyright.

This build was compiled just 30 minutes after the name "KuroWiki" was decided to replace the "LexWiki" naming, as part of negotiations between KuroWiki project founder [Nekori](Nekori64) and [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) founder and CEO [KayAurora](KayAurora) for the project to be moved inside Axeon's umbrella starting September 2025 (no KuroWiki development took place in August).
For the KuroWiki project, this essentially meant that it was expanding beyond Nekori-related things (In particular, Axeon and KayAurora-related topics would be accepted too), and that KayAurora (who previously contributed to the KuroWiki project before) would become one of KuroWiki's main developers.
