**KuroWiki** is an **open-source online encyclopedia** launched by the [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) on **XXXX XX, 2025**. Its main purpose is documenting meanings of inside jokes and random things of the Axeon Network.

Initially, KuroWiki was planned to be powered by MediaWiki with a custom user interface. However, it was decided instead to build a separate wiki engine, codenamed *Deltari*," using the **Jekyll static site generator**.

<!-- As of **June 29, 2025**, LexWiki is available under the `/wiki/` directory of [HoriWebsite](HoriWebsite)'s domain (`horibyte.is-a.dev`). Since its launch, it has seen continuous growth, with a growing number of articles. -->

The wiki reached **Alpha development status** on **May 6, 2025**. It is primarily developed by Lexibyte, with other tweaks and adjustments having been done by [KayAurora](KayAurora).

<!-- KuroWiki features a clean design that incorporates elements from **Material Design Lite (MDL)**. Key functionalities of the platform include a functional search bar (found at the top of the header) and a MDL drawer for linking resources regarding the wiki, version information and copyright strings. -->
