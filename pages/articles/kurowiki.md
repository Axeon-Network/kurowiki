**KuroWiki** is an **open-source online encyclopedia** launched by the [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) on **XXXX XX, 2025**. Its main purpose is documenting meanings of inside jokes and random things of the Axeon Network. It is primarily developed by [Nekori](Nekori), with other tweaks and adjustments having been done by [KayAurora](KayAurora).

KuroWiki was planned to be powered by MediaWiki with a custom user interface. However, it was decided instead to build a separate wiki engine, codenamed *Deltari*," using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Before an agreement between Nekori and KayAurora (members of the Axeon Network), KuroWiki was a Nekori-focused encyclopedia (known as **HoriWiki** and **LexWiki**), which was the main theme of the wiki until late August 2025.

After the agreement, KuroWiki expanded its content to not only cover Nekori stuff, but to also cover Axeon Network as a whole.
