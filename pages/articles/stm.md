**Stuffy's Tech Misadventures** was a video series planned for the [StuffyXP](StuffyXP) channel sometime between March 2024 and May 2024. It consisted of 5 total episodes[^1] before its cancellation in May 2024.

The series' name was heavily inspired by [Computer Clan](https://youtube.com/@ComputerClan)'s [Krazy Ken's Tech Misadventures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFWeyvvxf1rgv8sjVsycuaQKS-YszvbTy) video series. The series had a reboot sometime in May 2024 due to several failed attempts to get Episode 1 going.
