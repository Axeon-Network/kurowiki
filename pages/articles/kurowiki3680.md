**KuroWiki build 3680** (full tag: *5.2.3680.main.251012-0101*) is the official second **Interim Developer Release** (IDR) of **KuroWiki Beta 5.2**, and the final Beta 5 build known to exist. It was released on 12 October 2025 at 1:01 AM UTC+3 (4:01 PM UTC-6 the day prior).

Released just under 24 hours after the first IDR of KuroWiki Beta 5.2, [Build 3615](KuroWiki_build_3615), its main aim was to fix major bugs found in the aforementioned build with the mobile view and SpringViewer, the image viewer of KuroWiki. Additionally it brought an improved DeltaSearch 2.0, bringing a new Search experience.

Just like with Build 3615 (and other 5.2 builds for the matter), it is jokingly codenamed in the version information as KuroWikiXP due to its version number of 5.2 being identical to the Windows NT kernel version used in Windows Server 2003 and XP x64. The codename of *KuroWiki XP 2002 Server .NET Advanced Web Datacenter Blade Server Limited Edition 2003* was used as a way to mock the many names [Windows Server 2003](http://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Server_2003) used to have between 2001 and 2003."
