**KuroWiki build 3810** is the official third **Interim Developer Release** (IDR) of KuroWiki, compiled and released on 27 October 2025 at 5:15PM UTC-6.

A Beta 6 build of KuroWiki, it is the result of a merger between the `kayaurora` and `nekori64` branches, similarily with the official [Beta 5 build](KuroWiki_build_2600) and the [first](KuroWiki_build_3615) and [second](KuroWiki_build_3680) IDRs, both also being Beta 5 builds by themselves.

This main branch build introduced various features implemented after build 3680, most notably Dark Mode. A Settings page was added to include light theme as a choice for those who prefer it. A proper 404 Not Found page was also added (see [build 3689](KuroWiki_build_3689)).
