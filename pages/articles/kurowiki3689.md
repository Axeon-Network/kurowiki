**KuroWiki build 3689** is the first Beta 6 build of KuroWiki to be compiled from the `kayaurora` branch, on 13 October 2025 02:39 UTC+3 (17:39 UTC-6 the day prior).

The fourth Beta 6 build overall, it introduces a custom 404 Not Found page for when an user attempts to access a page that doesn't exist, also explaining as to "what's going on". Also a notice has been added to the [Contributing to KuroWiki](Contributing_to_KuroWiki) page that it is outdated in its then-iteration and that it will be completely rewritten soon.

This build was compiled with an issue in the homepage where the *Recent news* text was rendering white, issue related to testing Dark Mode in [a previous build](KuroWiki_build_3686) from the `nekori64` branch.
