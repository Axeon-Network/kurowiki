**MidoriMC** (previously known as **AxeonMC**) was a Minecraft Java Edition server for the community of the [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network), initially launched in May 2025 as a Survival 1.21.4 Fabric server. At the time of its closure (August 2025), it was a Creative Fabric server supporting both the 1.21.8 and 1.21.7 clients.

# History
## Early plans
Initial talks to launch a community Minecraft Server date back to mid-2019, with both either vanilla or modded Minecraft Java being taken into consideration. The first mentions of the name *AxeonMC* date back to July 2020.
Additionally, a Minecraft world containing a main "lobby" for the then-known as the "*Lynx-Axeon Minecraft Server*" has also been found dating back to January 2021; this world still exists to this day.

Tentatives at hosting a Minecraft Server date back to summer 2018, when the then-known-as Axeon Community was planning a joined game night with one of its partnered Discord Servers. However, this never happened.

The idea of an "AxeonMC" had been dusted off once more in March 2025, following the closure of [the original Horicraft](Horicraft) caused by a disagreement between the server hoster and [Kit](Kit), the owner of Horicraft. However this never happened as the [Horicraft (2)](Horicraft_(2)) server came to life just a few days later.

## Server launch
An experimental AxeonMC Minecraft server was set up as a Survival 1.21.4 Fabric server on 4 May 2025, which was then formally announced on the Axeon Network Discord Server a few days later.
Both AxeonMC (hosted by [KayAurora](KayAurora)) and Horicraft (2) (hosted by Kit) would co-exist for a while, both being two separate Survival servers, leading up to the latter's closure.

## Merger of Horicraft and AxeonMC
On 18 May 2025, after an agreement between Kit (the owner of Horicraft) and KayAurora (the owner of AxeonMC), AxeonMC changed to a Creative server using the world of the original Horicraft, this change also gave a new name to the project: MidoriMC. This provided a semi-official, Kit-endorsed continuation of the original Horicraft.
By late May, MidoriMC saw a peak of around 5 concurrent online players, with most activity concentrating around the cities of [Fucking](Fucking) and [Jell](Jell) respectively.

Another Kit-KayAurora agreement around mid-June 2025 saw MidoriMC go through a "world reset". The world would keep using the Horicraft world seed but everything would essentially start over from scratch.

New ideas to enhance the MidoriMC in-game experience have came up around July 2025. One of the proposals included adding more server-side mods in game to further distinguish the MidoriMC experience from the normal Vanilla experience. Additionally, moving MidoriMC hosting inside a container (the software of choice being Podman at this time) has also been considered to help improve stability (i.e. better crash handling) and overall uptime.
Another idea was to unify the MidoriMC in-game chat and the Axeon Network Discord and Stoat servers together under a *#global* text channel, forming an "actual network". That said, none of these ideas came to life, due to KayAurora's dwindling interest to continue operating MidoriMC at all.

## Server closure
On 1 August 2025, KayAurora announced that MidoriMC would officially go offline for good, as by that point there was low player activity on the server for most of the time, and as such continuing to operate it would have been essentially pointless.
