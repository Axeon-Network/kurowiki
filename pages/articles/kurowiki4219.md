**KuroWiki build 4219** is a Beta 6 build of KuroWiki, compiled on 25 November 2025 at 4:13PM UTC+2 from the `kayaurora` development branch

This build adds two new Deltari configuration variables, `background-dark` and `background-light`, allowing to easily set a custom background than the default ones used since [build 3842](KuroWiki_build_3842).

Oneko is now functional as well, however the Settings toggle has yet to be implemented in a later build.
