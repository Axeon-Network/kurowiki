**KuroWiki build 3889** is a Beta 6 build of KuroWiki, compiled on 27 October 2025 at 5:15PM UTC-6 from the `nekori64` development branch

A screenshot of this build was shared on Discord showing an early implementation of the Infobox, a box displaying a quick summary of what's in an article, albeit in a broken state (as with the rest of the page shown in the screenshot, no CSS is loaded and even some Jekyll tags fail to work).
