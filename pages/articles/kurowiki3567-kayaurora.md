**KuroWiki build 3567** (full tag: `5.2.3567.kayaurora.251009-0049`) is a build of [KuroWiki](KuroWiki) Beta 5.2, compiled on 9 October 2025 at 00:49 UTC+3 (15:49 UTC-6 the day before) from the `kayaurora` development branch.

This build is mainly notable for sharing the same build number with the very first known KuroWiki build, [*2.4.3567.main-wik.250504-1045*](KuroWiki_build_3567_(main_wik)), which was in fact just the [HoriWebsite](HoriWebsite) frontend.

Additionally, it brought a near-final form of the new *Featured article* box, work for which was initially started in build 3526 on the same branch.
Both the *Featured article* and *Did you know...* cards now properly display on the homepage on large screens as well (small screen/mobile support came in later builds).
