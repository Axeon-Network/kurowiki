<h4 id="C">C</h4>
<hr>

<h5 id="Cosmos">Cosmos</h5>

Codename for a revamp of the [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) Discord Server in July 2018.

<h4 id="L">L</h4>
<hr>

<h5 id="Lyra">Lyra</h5>

Codename for the Discord server that would have resulted from the merge between [LynxPlaza](Axeon_Network) and [HoriServer (2)](HoriServer_(2)) following the general sunsetting of the [Lynxmic](Lynxmic) project in April 2025. Later cancelled as a result of the [HoriServer (2) incident](April_2025_HoriServer_(2)_Incident).

<h4 id="O">O</h4>
<hr>

<h5 id="Orchid">Orchid</h5>

Codename used for various later-cancelled projects for the [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) in multiple instances since 2023:
- **The *Orchid* Discord Bot** (May 2023): spiritual successor (but unrelated) to 2018's *AxeonBot*, used as a complementary extension to existing 3rd-party bots already in use in Axeon Network (at the time known as Lynxmic's Square). The original bot account for it would later change to report the online status of [MidoriMC](MidoriMC) on Discord.
- **The *Orchid* Revolt Bot** (February 2025): a multi-purpose bot with many features that anyone could add to their very own Revolt servers (similar to [Venus](Venus) feature-wise). The original bot account would later be deleted in March 2025.
- ***Project Orchid*** (July 2025): linking together all chats of the Axeon Network (the Discord Server, the Revolt Server, and the MidoriMC in-game chat).
     - An example on how the idea would go: someone from Discord sends a message to the `#global` text channel on Discord and it would show up on the `#global` text channel on Revolt or vice-versa. Messages from both channels from Discord and Revolt would show up in the MidoriMC in-game chat as well, and people online on MidoriMC can choose to have their messages go on both channels on Discord and Revolt as well.

<hr>

<h5 id="Photon">Photon</h5>

Name used for a planned new tech-oriented YouTube channel throughout February 2025.

<h5 id="Preventemod">Preventemod</h5>

Name used for a project for a separate moderation bot for Discord that has been worked on in 2018, later cancelled.
The name can be understood as sort of a combination between the words "prevent" ("*to prevent [bad event]*") and "mod" ("*to moderate - take action to stop/prevent [bad event]*"), with the letter "*e*" added between them in an attempt to create a more unique, fluent name.

<h4 id="R">R</h4>
<hr>

<h5 id="Ruby">Ruby</h5>

Name used for a project for a separate fun-oriented bot for Discord from 2018-19, also later cancelled.
Ruby's bot account still exists to this day and it is planned it may be reused at some point for a future project for the Axeon Network.

<h4 id="U">U</h4>
<hr>

<h5 id="Uranus">Uranus</h5>

A replacement name for [Sapphire](Sapphire).

<h4 id="W">W</h4>
<hr>

<h5 id="Whirlpool">Whirlpool</h5>

Name used for the *Whirlpool Bot Plaza* Discord Server in November 2018, which was gonna be an unified place for support for both [Venus](Venus) and [Uranus](Sapphire) before the latter project was cancelled.
