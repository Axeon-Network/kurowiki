**KuroWiki build 4074** is a Beta 6 build of KuroWiki, compiled on 27 October 2025 at 6:30PM UTC-6 from the `nekori64` development branch

Screenshots of this build were publicly shared on the [NekoCafe ft. AstroNT](NekoCafe) and [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) Discord Servers, as well as a video of it made available on [Nekori](Nekori64)'s YouTube [channel](https://youtu.be/AadFTp3So8E).

The product of an internal Jekyll bug, it is also known as the **Purgatory Build**. A plethora of articles were not included with this build as they would have blocked the compilation of this build otherwise. Technically speaking, Jekyll doesn't accept files encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, and any attempt to locally run a KuroWiki build from this branch would have led to an `Liquid Exception: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8` error.
