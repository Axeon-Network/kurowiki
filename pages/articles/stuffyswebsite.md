**Stuffy's Website** (commongly abbreviated as **StuffyWebsite**, **Stuffy Website WOU**, or just **WOU**) was [Nekori](Nekori64)'s personal website from June 2024 to August 2024. It was succeded by the [StuffyXP Website](StuffyXP_Website) in September 2024.

The website is currently available at [nekori64.github.io/stuffyxp-website/stuffywebsitewou](https://nekori64.github.io/stuffyxp-website/stuffywebsitewou), previously being available at [HoriWebsite]'s domain, and `stuffyxp.github.io`.

#### Development

Shortly after [the original Stuffy Website](Stuffy's_Website_(May_2024)) source code was lost, Nekori restarted the development of the new website, this time with the same name, as it was a ""rewrite"".

Nekori used the same tools that they used in the previous iteration of the website, that is, the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS Framework and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Since Bulma v2.0 was recently released the time, Nekori used a tabbed layout as the new interface of their website. The interface somewhat resembeled [KayAurora](KayAurora)'s [LynxWebsite](LynxWebsite).

Development of Stuffy's Website was finished on 24 June 2024.

##### Stuffy's Website! Public Beta

A public beta release of the website was released on 22 June 2024 as a way to test the website in a production environment. It included an exclusive Issues page where it listed the known issues of the website at that point.

These issues were stuff like the favicon not loading in Firefox-based browsers, or the font being italic on Chromium-based browsers, along other things.

The finished version was released 2 days later, on 24 June 2024.

##### Week One Update

**Stuffy's Website: Week One Update** (commongly abbreviated as **Week One Update** or **WOU**) is the first and only update to Stuffy's Website. It was released on 27 June 2024.

It mainly consisted of bugfixes, favicon linking fixes and a proper mobile UI.

##### Version 1.2

**Stuffy's Website: Everybody Features! Update**, commongly reffered to as Version 1.2, was an upcoming version of Stuffy's Website. This version was announced to be on development on 20 July 2024. It was eventually forgotten by Nekori, which lead to its cancellation.

It was later reimagined into the StuffyXP Website.
