**NovaServer** is a server on the Discord alternative [Stoat](https://stoat.chat) (formerly revolt.chat). The server existed since 19 July 2025 as a spiritual successor to the original Stoat [HoriServer](HoriServer), and was publicly announced on the [Axeon Network](Axeon_Network) Discord and Stoat servers on 26 July 2025.

Just like with HoriServer, it was created as a result of [Kit](Kit64) taking a break from Discord, which later evolved into a general break from the internet throughout August 2025 as their IRL situation continued worsening. During this time, NovaServer was Kit's sole means of communication with occasional check-ins every now and then until the official end of their internet break in 28 August.

The server was ultimately succeeded on 31 August 2025 by [Nishi's Den](Nishi's_Den), Kit's first Discord Server since [HoriServer (2)](HoriServer_(2)) that closed 4 months prior. A Stoat port of said Discord Server was later created on 11 November 2025 as [Nishi's Den SE](Nishi's_Den#Stoat_version) (SE meaning *Stoat Edition*). NovaServer still exists to this day but remains unused.
