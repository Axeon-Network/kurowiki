**Lynxmic** (previously known as **solarixtech**, **BriciWorld** and **Computerseasons**) is a tech-focused YouTube channel ran and owned by [KayAurora](KayAurora) launched on 5 December 2016.

It is the first created of KayAurora's main channels to be completely in the English language from the start. The channel's content includes a wide range of really anything technology-related. Newer videos primarily deal with Virtual Machines or sometimes even actual hardware playing around with Windows, Linux or any other interesting operating system, but the entire catalog also includes phone videos, as well as mainly text-only "opinion" or "tech news" videos and previously "updates" videos, discontinued in favor of just using social media and YouTube's Community Tab (now the *Posts* tab) upon rollout.

In April 2025, KayAurora announced the stopping of new Lynxmic content due to dwindling interest and motivation. Occasional new videos and streams would still come out, but would be spontaneous and low-quality.

As of November 2025, the channel has over 1,500+ subscribers and 125+ public videos - the largest of KayAurora's channels. In total, the channel has about 330 videos including ones set as unlisted or private. A list of Lynxmic videos can be found [here](List_of_Lynxmic_videos).

# History
## 2016-2017: Backstory, *Computerseasons*, channel beginnings
The backstory of the online identity that would eventually become **Computerseasons** dates back to early September 2016, when KayAurora discovered several small mainly tech-oriented YouTube channels in English language, some which were blowing up at this time, and started watching them. Later on 27 October 2016, KayAurora created their first Discord Account under a different online alias.

The Lynxmic channel was initially created as Computerseasons on 5 December 2016, when KayAurora got [their first laptop](Toshiba_Laptop), as it was becoming increasingly clear that a separate online identity was an ideal must for the English stuff as opposed to the primarily-native-language one at the time (which was eventually retired by mid-2017). Their Discord Account and Server at the time also took the Computerseasons name.

Later on 24 December 2016, the Computerseasons Twitter Account would be created under the handle `@ComputerStudio2` (today `@Lynxmic`), which would be primarily used to interact with English-language accounts. This account would however stay mostly inactive until around July 2017, when it began to be used until KayAurora quit Twitter in 2023 in favor of the Fediverse.

2016 videos mostly consisted of videos made with the Adobe Flash-based YT Video Editor or RAW unedited recordings. Today, only one of the 2016 videos still exist, albeit private for privacy reasons.

January 2017 saw the launch of the second/extras channel of Computerseasons, named **Computerseasons2** (today MoreLynxmic), in fact a channel that already existed on YouTube since 3 May 2015 but repurposed.

KayAurora continued to post several random videos to the Computerseasons channel until new content inexplicably ceased in April 2017. No more videos would be posted until August 2017, when the channel was rebooted as **BriciWorld Productions** (BWP), this time with more proper edited videos, using Camtasia Studio 8. The intro and outro first became standard elements of a BWP video around this time. Most of the pre-BWP 2016-17 videos were deleted around this time for unknown reasons. In October 2017, the channel was renamed just **BriciWorld**, receiving the branding of KayAurora's then actual online identity which had been used since late July 2017 for consistency.

December 2017 saw the release of the video *How to get Visual Studio Code Rich Presence for Discord*, which would end up the most viewed video on the channel until being finally surpassed in 2022 at just past 4K views. The year ended with the channel only having just over 10 subs.
