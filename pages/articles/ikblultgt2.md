**%iKBLULTGT2%** is the name for an Intel HD Graphics driver modded to work under Windows 7 on [Thei5Lappy](Thei5Lappy) (Dell Latitude 3380), which uses a 7th gen Intel CPU (codenamed Kaby Lake), which officially delibrately does not support any version of Windows that's not Windows 10.

While official Windows 7 drivers do exist for the Latitude 3380, no official integrated graphics driver has been found to work, leading to this.

The full name meaning has been decoded as follows:
- `i` = Intel
- `KBL` = Kaby Lake
- `ULT` = Ultra Low Power (U-series)
- `GT2` = Graphics Technology level 2
