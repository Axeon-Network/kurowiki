**Horicraft (2)** was a survival Minecraft server owned & operated by [Nekori](Nekori) founded on 14 March 2025 and closed on 18 May 2025. It is the spiritual successor to the [original Horicraft server](Horicraft) after being closed due to a disagreement between the server hoster and Nekori.

The server closed due to lack of interest in maintaining the server on Nekori's side.

### Trivia

This section contains a list of Horicraft (2) trivia

- The server was originally gonna be hosted on another computer, before Nekori's parents disallowed them.
- Nekori and [KayAurora](KayAurora) were the first members of Horicraft (2), both joined shortly after the server was online for its first time. Nekori's YouTube channel has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3bE3yBXduY&t=25s) of both playing in the server in its early days.
- The seed for the Horicraft (2) world is `theoneandonlycomet`, referencing Nekori's OC (**O**riginal **C**haracter), [Comet](Comet).
- Nekori's house on the server is a direct remake of their Horicraft 1 house.
- Horicraft (2)'s motd is "Horicraft (2): the return of [Dogui Heavy Industries](Dogui_Heavy_Industries_Incorporated) and [Cairo Company](Cairo_Company_Incorporated)" and Nekori's title tag for the run-server-batch-script is "Run Horicraft (2): the return of Yoshito Hori".
- So far, Cairo Company HQ has been built, DHI HQ is yet to be build on the world.
- In the [NovaLand](NovaLand) lore, the world where Horicraft (2) takes place is the [Starlight](Fucking,_NovaLand#Starlight) district of [Fucking](Fucking,_NovaLand).

Horicraft (2) is planned to close on May 18 or May 24 2025 to merge with the original [Horicraft](Horicraft) to a new Minecraft server operated by Nekori. This decision was made in order to revive both Horicraft projects after Nekori's demotivation on keeping both alive.
