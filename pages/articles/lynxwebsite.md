**LynxWebsite** (also known as **Lynxmic Website** or after its URL name of **lynxmic.github.io**) was [KayAurora](KayAurora)'s personal website from August 2023 to July 2024, when it merged with the [Lynxmic Blog](Lynxmic_Blog) project to form [KayWebsite](KayWebsite).

Developed with Jekyll using the Bulma CSS framework and hosted on GitHub Pages, it was initially meant to serve as a replacement for KayAurora's Linktree page, rather serving as a landing page with links to social media and other projects, and of course, the blog.

With initial development dating back to early July 2023, before fully replacing the Lynxmic Blog as the lynxmic.github.io homepage entirely in late August 2023, with a beta available for a short period of time before.
A "v2.0" redesign followed on 1 January 2024, where the website saw a transformation from being just a page with links to an all-round personal website, then on 25 April 2024 followed another notable redesign where it switched from a scroll layout to a tabbed layout, with features such a Light/Dark Mode switcher added to take advantage of the features of then-recently-released Bulma v1.
