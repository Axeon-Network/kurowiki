**KuroWiki build 4232** is a Beta 6 build of KuroWiki, compiled on 28 November 2025 at 11:35PM UTC+2 from the `kayaurora` development branch

This build makes the Oneko toggle functional in the Settings page as *Cat friend :3*. The toggle is disabled by default, as such the Oneko cat no longer shows up by default (as it was in the previous [build 4219](KuroWiki_build_4219]) unless the toggle is enabled.
