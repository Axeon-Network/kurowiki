**Nekori Moments** (*formerly known as **Horibyte Moments** and **Stuffy Moments***) are moments when Nekori breaks any sort of tech (that being software, hardware, services, etc) in an unexpected way. They were introduced in January 2024.

#### Types of Nekori moments
Nekori moments can vary from a range of 'moment levels', with that being the following:
- **Errors**: Said moments can be various errors, being just normal ones, or something extremely rare.Â
