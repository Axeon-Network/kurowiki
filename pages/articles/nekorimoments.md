**Nekori Moments** (*formerly known as **Horibyte Moments** and **Stuffy Moments***) are moments when Nekori breaks any sort of tech (that being software, hardware, services, etc) in an unexpected way.

The original term of "average stuffy moment" was first used by a member of the [Stuffy's Place](Stuffys_Place) Discord server, which started the idea of the Nekori moment back in January 2024.

#### Types of Nekori moments
Nekori moments can vary from a range of 'moment levels', with that being the following:
 * **Errors**: Said moments can be various errors, being just normal ones, or something extremely rare.<br>

* **Software Gore**: These moments are when software breaks in a funny and weird way, these are the most common Nekori Moments.<br>
