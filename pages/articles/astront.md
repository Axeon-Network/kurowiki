# Background

The StuffyXP channel was deleted in March 2025 due to Nekori's mental status with no plans of going back at that time, regardless, two tech-related videos were uploaded to [Nekori's personal channel](https://youtube.com/@Nekori64) in May 2025.

Shortly after Nekori's August Discord return, Nekori started to gain nostalgia for the StuffyXP channels and [its respective Discord server](StuffyXP_Hangout). Afterwards, a StuffyXP successor (codenamed *StuffyXP 2*) was revealed by Nekori in September 2025.

<!--# Videos

As of November 2025, there are 3 videos uploaded to the AstroNT channel (excluding the channel trailer):

# AstroNT Advanced Server

**AstroNT Advanced Server**[^2] (formerly known as **AstroNT Datacenter**[^3] and **StuffyXP 2 Hangout**) is a private Discord server owned by Nekori64 used for talk about future AstroNT plans. It was created on 16 September 2025.

Before the launch of AstroNT, the server was used to discuss the development of the AstroNT channel, such as the name and branding. As of now it is primarily used for future video planning away from the public eye.
