<summary>Axeon KuroWiki Interim Developer Release 3 now available</summary>
We are pleased to announce that the third Interim Developer Release of KuroWiki is now available to the world-wide public. This release builds upon the code-base of KuroWiki Beta 6, which showcases improvements and new additions previously only available to internal builds.

We look forward on the development of KuroWiki, and soon enough, a potential Release Candidate!

Any comments or suggestions? We're all ears! Feel free to sumbit any feedback in GitHub Issues or our Discord Server!

Sincerely,<br>The KuroWiki Developer Team.

<summary>KuroWiki Beta 6 in development</summary>
KuroWiki beta 6 is now officially under development. This will expand further the capabilities of the Deltari engine (as we plan it to have a self-host version for anyone to use), add new articles to make the wiki more complete, make the website more stable, amongst other things.

We look forward for a public release in November.

Remember, any comments? We're all ears! Feel free to sumbit any feedback in GitHub Issues or our Discord Server

Sincerely,<br>The KuroWiki Developer Team.
