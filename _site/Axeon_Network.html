            <p><strong>Axeon Network</strong> (more commonly known as just <strong>Axeon</strong>) is a network consisting of community-oriented projects. Mainly known for the Discord Server (founded on 28 December 2017 by KayAurora), which had always been the ‘heart’ of the network from the start, other stuff include a Revolt server of the same name, <a href="KuroWiki">KuroWiki</a>, and previously <a href="MidoriMC">MidoriMC</a> prior to its closure.</p>

<p>Throughout the lifetime of Axeon, specifically in 2018-19, a couple of other community hangout spaces also existed in the form of a Twitch Desktop server, as well as a Steam Chat group. Other projects planned in 2018 but never actually made include <em>AxeonAuth</em> (a so-called “moderation bot” which is in fact actually a custom solution for member verification on Discord), <em>i.axeon</em> (a custom ShareX Image Uploader service), or <em>Meme FM</em> (a radio bot for Discord that would play “new and old” meme songs).<br />
A more notable recent project idea from July 2025 would’ve been a bot unifying both the Discord server, the Revolt server and the MidoriMC in-game chat under a <em>#global</em> text channel, however this was also shelved due to MidoriMC’s closure.</p>

<p>Social media presence of Axeon included the official Twitter Account (posting various updates and highlights from the Discord Server), as well as an YouTube channel known as <em>Axeon Productions</em> during 2020.</p>

<h5 id="discord-server">Discord Server</h5>
<p>By far, the Discord Server of the same name is the flagship of the Axeon Network.<br />
Initially known as Aqua Community, the server was created on 18 December 2017, but wouldn’t open until 10 days later, allowing KayAurora to come up with ideas and an overall strategy for the server.</p>

<p>its initial scope was to serve as a spiritual successor to the <a href="BriciWorld_Lounge">BriciWorld Lounge</a> (BWL) server, which was slowly collapsing. Unlike predecessors, the server has been thought to be more widely promoted as more than just being “about KayAurora”, with a clear own strategy of “bringing people together” from the very beginning. It was aligned with then’s reality within the server’s then-surrounding community circle, where Discord servers were often commonly named after random words, to which either “Community” or “Lounge” is appended.</p>

<p>The server was renamed to Axeon Community in April 2018, and the Axeon logo has reached its current form in June 2018. By the same month, it has went past the 100 member milestone, peaking at just over 120 members in early 2019. The server had for a while also went by “Lynx-Axeon” during early-to-mid 2021, as a result of the breakaway LynxPlaza server merging back in late 2020 after having previously spun off a year prior.</p>

<p>After 2020, the server has seen a decline in activity. 2022 has seen the lowest activity in the server, with only very few occasional messages per month. The server member count had gone down to around 60 members. After a prune of inactive Discord accounts, this count has gone down to just under 30.<br />
In late 2022, an attempt to revive the server has been made, with a major revamp ditching the “Axeon” name in favor of “Lynxmic’s Square”. The server became to be revolved around the Lynxmic project. In January 2024, the server received another major revamp. The server has seen increased activity over time thanks to the substantial growth of the Lynxmic YT channel. In August 2024, the server had been renamed once more to “LynxPlaza”, reasserting the server’s primary focus as being the Lynxmic project, following KayAurora’s personal alias rebrand from Lynxmic to Clyron.</p>

<p>In early April 2025, KayAurora officially announced the sunsetting of the Lynxmic project in most cases. Initial plans were for LynxPlaza to eventually merge with <a href="Nekori">Nekori</a>’s <a href="HoriServer_(2)">HoriServer (2)</a>, which would become <em>Lyra</em>. However these plans were never pursued due to <a href="April_2025_HoriServer_(2)_Incident">HoriServer (2)’s implosion</a>.<br />
On 30 April 2025, LynxPlaza has been renamed to its current name of Axeon Network, shifting away from being a Lynxmic-focused server to being its own entity again. Axeon has seen another revamp with application-based joins using Discord’s native Member Application feature (later reverted in June 2025).<br />
Axeon Network has since de facto became a replacement for HoriServer (2), before the launch of <a href="NekoCafe">NekoCafe</a> in September 2025.</p>

<p>On 8 September 2025, the Axeon Network Discord Server re-reached 100 members.</p>

<h6 id="custom-server-specific-discord-bots">Custom server-specific Discord Bots</h6>
<p>Initially, there were several bots hosted specifically for the Axeon Network server, all which started operating in late 2017-early 2018:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AxeonBot</strong>: initially known as AquaBot, it was in fact a selfhosted instance of GAwesomeBot. In May 2018, AxeonBot switched to running a separate instance of <a href="Venus">Venus</a>. The bot was discontinued in August 2018 in favor of other 3rd-party bots.</li>
  <li><strong>AxeonMusic</strong>: initially known as AquaMusic, it was a selfhosted instance of JMusicBot, which the community could use to play music of their choice in VC. The bot was discontinued in July 2019 in favor of other 3rd-party bots.</li>
  <li><strong>AxeonRadio</strong>: initially known as AquaRadio, it was also a selfhosted instance of JMusicBot, with the difference being that it was a playlist of music curated by Axeon managers and community. The bot was discontinued in April 2018 in favor of AxeonMusic bearing the radio stuff. The bot account for AxeonRadio was later renamed to <strong>AxeonAuth</strong> (planned as an all-in “moderation bot”) but then later abandoned entirely.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="kurowiki">KuroWiki</h5>
<p><em>Main article: <a href="KuroWiki">KuroWiki</a></em></p>

<p><strong>KuroWiki</strong> (previously known as <strong>LexWiki</strong> and <strong>HoriWiki</strong>) is an open-source online encyclopedia using the custom-built <em>Deltari</em> wiki engine initially started and developed by <a href="Nekori">Nekori</a> in May 2025.<br />
Initially started with a main purpose of documenting meanings of inside jokes and other random Nekori-related stuff, it has since expanded to a whole wiki covering a wider range of topics, including Axeon and KayAurora-related things, since becoming a project part of the Axeon Network in September 2025.</p>

<p>As of September 2025, KuroWiki has reached Beta 5.</p>

<h5 id="midorimc">MidoriMC</h5>
<p><em>Main article: <a href="MidoriMC">MidoriMC</a></em></p>

<p><strong>MidoriMC</strong> (previously known as <strong>AxeonMC</strong>) was a Minecraft Java Edition server for the community of Axeon. The server was officially announced on 11 May 2025 as a Survival 1.21.4 Fabric server with its own world.</p>

<p>Roughly a week later, on 18 May 2025, AxeonMC was renamed MidoriMC and changed from a Survival world to a Creative world, using the same world found in <a href="Horicraft">the original Horicraft</a> (Nekori’s Minecraft server), as its semi-official continuation. Later on, the world was reset with everything started anew while continuing to use the Horicraft world seed.</p>

<p>Over time, the server had been updated to 1.21.5, then to 1.21.6 and to 1.21.7. On 1 August 2025, it was announced that MidoriMC would go offline for good, due to lack of players most of the time and thus lack of interest to keep it online. At its peak, MidoriMC had around 5 concurrent online players, this being in late May 2025.</p>

<h5 id="iaxeon">i.axeon</h5>
<p><strong>i.axeon</strong> (also known as the <strong>Axeon Image Uploader</strong>) was a planned online image uploading service during early 2018 primarily meant to be used with ShareX. Images uploaded to the service would be under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i.axeoncommunity.ml</code> subdomain ready to link on Discord or generally other places of the Internet where attaching images is otherwise not a feature.</p>

<p>The idea was cancelled due to its complex nature, and due to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axeoncommunity.ml</code> website’s switch to GitHub Pages from the free web hosting service it was previously using due to issues with images not properly displaying on the website.<br />
No plans exist to pick up this project back, with KayAurora now <a href="https://archive.ph/OWZN2">generally against</a> using image uploading services altogether especially for Discord due to higher risk of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> and thus media being lost.</p>

<h5 id="axeonwebsite">AxeonWebsite</h5>
<p><strong>AxeonWebsite</strong> (previously known as <strong>AquaWebsite</strong>) was the official website of the Axeon Network since January 2018 until July 2019, when KayAurora announced they were quitting coding at the time.</p>

<p>Initially built by a former member of the Axeon Network Discord Server using the Materialize CSS framework, it was later rebuilt by KayAurora using MDBootstrap just a few weeks later (due to Materialize not being aesthetically pleasing), iteration which would remain for the rest of the website’s lifetime.</p>

<p>AxeonWebsite was primarily designed to promote the Axeon Network Discord Server, including an About section including a list of key features of the server that make it “stand out” from others, as well as a list of all members of the Axeon Network Discord Server’s staff team. It has also served as a portal to other Axeon-related stuff over time.</p>

<p>Initially on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aquacommunity.ml</code> domain, it has moved to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">axeoncommunity.ml</code> following the rebrand from Aqua Community to Axeon Community in April 2018, domain which would remain for the remainder of the website’s lifetime. As previously stated, a subdomain of the same domain was planned to be used for <em>i.axeon</em> as well.<br />
The website has been hosted on GitHub Pages since May 2018, and initially on a different free web hosting service, from which it migrated due to persisting issues loading media under said provider.</p>

<p>A newer spiritual successor to the 2018-19 AxeonWebsite (but not actually related in any way) would be <a href="http://axeon-network.github.io"><strong>axeon-network.github.io</strong></a>, based on an in-development build of <a href="KayWebsite">KayWebsite v3.3</a>. This website launched in September 2025 with a single purpose of linking to various Axeon-related things for convenience, in the context of the KuroWiki project becoming part of the Axeon Network.</p>
