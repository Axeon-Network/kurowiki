<!-- #### [Loreside](KuroWiki%3ALoreside)

The company was founded in early 1993 as Dogui Heavy Coding Industries (whose purposes was split into a subsidiary called **DHISoft**), and became the most profitable business in [StuffyLand](NovaLand) December 2010.

The company has a history of filing for Chapter Nine Bankruptcy two times in 2013 and 2018 respectively. Both being due to loss of profit due to bad quality of products, the most notable case being in 12 January 2005 where the company's products were affected by computer glitches ([Nekori Moments](Nekori_Moments)), the company slowly kept losing money until 2013 and gained a bad reputation.

In July 2013 the company filed for Chapter Nine Bankruptcy, which allowed them to try to make a plan to gain enough money to cover up the debt (NSB. 250,000,000).

In December 2013, a new CEO was put in place, they used all their salary to fund DHI Turtles LLC, an organization to *protect, save and rescue NovaLandese turtles*. The company paid off with donations recieved from DHI Turtles, the NovaLandese Goverment donated NSB. 300,000,000 as a way to keep the company on business. The company regained its reputation after making a promise to use 67% of their money to help DHI Turtles.

After the Economy Crash of 2017, DHI suffered a loss of NSB. 761,000,000 which made both DHI and DHI Turtles file for Bankruptcy Chapter Nine again, not only for the economy crash, poor employee and product management resulted in a 2% layoff which made DHI loss about NSB. 500,000. Another CEO was put in place to better manage money and products, as well as internal company disputes.

The company was barely keeping itself alive in 2019 until COVID-19 struck StuffyLand, DHI founded DHI Movies, a movie studio for the citizen's entertainment while at home.

The company successfully recovered from the crash (in fact, was only one of the two to do so) and gained around LXL 1B due to the massive success of DHI Movies, and several donations for DHI Turtles. The company became the most profitable business in the country again in August 2021 due to a new CEO, [Nekori](Nekori). -->
