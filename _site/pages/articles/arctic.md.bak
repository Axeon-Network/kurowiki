**Horibyte Arctic**[&sup1;](#notec1){: id="note1"} is an open-source operating system mantained and developed by [Horibyte](Horibyte) for personal computers. It was first released on May 26 2025 and is available on GitHub. ([github.com/horibyte/arctic](https://github.com/horibyte/arctic))

<p id="caption">QEMU running Horibyte Arctic 0.1.5</p>


Arctic is *only* compatible with QEMU and VMware, this is due to how other virtualizors and emulators manage image files, as QEMU and VMware do not care if the disk has a file system in it or not.

The latest stable release is 0.1.5 (as of 27 May 2025).

#### Overview

Horibyte Arctic is a 16-bit real mode system, thus making it compatible with as low as an Intel 8088 (citation needed), these are the suggested recommended system requirements (according to Horibyte):

- A 486 processor
- 4 MB of RAM
- A floppy disk drive
- Keyboard
- A VGA card

Arctic also supports the following commands (info text taken from 0.1.5):

```
help            Display this help message
clear           Clear the screen
echo <text>     Prints text (e.g., echo Hello World)
ver             Display version information
shutdown        Halts the system
```
*(More commands coming soon!)*

#### Development

Arctic started development as far back as 26 May 2025 (sourced from a Discord server where Horibyte talks) with a CLI as it's main UI. All of the development builds available (as of 27 May 2025) are written in Assembly.

However, several instances of a `LeafyOS` VM have been found in Horibyte's VMware VM library, and several `kernel.bin` files have been mentioned (or even taken a screenshot of) by Horibyte themselves. All of the kernel.bin files have been lost by Horibyte, though.


**Lab02**, one of the virtual development labs have code for a 32-bit version of Arctic 0.1.5 (namely [Arctic32](Arctic32)), claimed by Horibyte, said build is not stable.

The source code has been uploaded to GitHub.

**Lab03**'s purpose is to test main servicing changes within the operating system's code, the most notable project of it is the ***Horibyte Arctic Setup Program***.

None of the code within these development labs have been shared by Horibyte, but screenshots of them have

#### Kernel overview

The Arctic load process consists of 3 files:

1. `bootloader.bin` - the Arctic Bootloader (*internally code named Midori*), which loads `osload.bin`.
2. `osload.bin` - the in-between from the bootloader and kernel to load necessary functions and other stuff to successfully launch `rekanto.bin`.
3. `rekanto.bin` - the main Arctic kernel (*code named ReKanto*), containing all of the commands and drivers for the operating system.

The Arctic kernel is a monolithic kernel due to its current simplicity. The code name comes from the *Kanto* region from **Pokémon Red & Blue**, and a "Re" was added due to the original Kanto kernel being rewritten due to issues with 32-bit protected mode.

As it is, Arctic currently is only on 16-bit real mode, due to the aftermentioned issues while transferring from 16-bit to 32-bit.

#### The Mockup Era™ Gallery

*This is a gallery of the finished Arctic Mockups*

Before starting development, Arctic mockups were created by Horibyte in GIMP.
None of these are real screenshots of builds.............*yet!*
